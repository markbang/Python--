This is attributed to the rapid growth of computer science to actively respond to the information society and science, which is attempting to interpret and assign new values to information. It can be said that the ultimate goal of library and information science is to develop a processing method to provide users with the most rapidly and accurately optimal information for the exponentially increasing variety of information.\n\nIn response to these demands, library and information science, which was renewed in the early 1960s, differs from the research methodology of traditional library science, with a purely scientific aspect that mainly pursues general principles on the generation, nature, behavior, and distribution of information; It can be said that it is a discipline that includes both applied science aspects related to the design and operation of an effective and efficient information distribution system.\n\nSpecifically,  the characteristics of the information society, the research subject of library and information science is the distribution of scientific information through scientific literature and informal communication of scientific groups. As a methodology to scientifically investigate this phenomenon, library and information science has researched and developed a methodology called Bibliometrics or Science-metrics.\n",

The increasing specialization and segmentation of fields of study has resulted in a vast amount of intellectual assets. The school is designed to reorganize these assets to pursue new scientific knowledge and value in an integrated manner, thereby contributing to the solutions of various pressing problems that face today's scientific community and society at large, all while training personnel to acquire the ability to work for this end.\nIt has three departments. The Department of Kansei Science aims to train highly skilled personnel who can lead in the creation of kansei value from the perspectives of the users, the main beneficiaries of knowledge, and with the correct understanding of human kansei needs. The Department of Automotive Science aims to train specialists to acquire the ability to contribute to the creation of a new automotive society based on an integrated and advanced knowledge of automobiles, state-of-the-art technologies, human needs, and society. And the Department of Library Science aims to train specialists required for the \"field of the library\" where new knowledge is created and maintained to enable user-oriented information management and provision.\n",

            "iSchoolDescription": "The School of Information Management is one of the pioneers in Information Management education in China. As the rapid development and constant outstanding performance, the school won high reputation both inside and outside the country. For example, the discipline named “Library, Information and Archive Management” represents the highest quality of LIS schools in China, which is voted as a candidate of world outstanding disciplines in National Outstanding Discipline Support Plan, and ranked A+ place in the discipline evaluation in China in 2017. Besides that, Information Science of our school is a National Key Discipline in 2007, “Library, Information and Archive Management” is a superiority discipline in Jiangsu Province in 2014. What’s more, our school plays a very important role in LIS community, it contains many steering academic organizations such as the Secretariat Office of Education Directive Committee for Professional Master of Publishing, the Strategy Consultant and Secretariat Office of Education for Secrecy Science, and so on.\n\nSince 1913, the more than 100 years’ history has seen the rapid development of our school. We first offered library courses in China in 1913, then set up departments in 1927. Yizheng Liu, Xiaoshi Hu, Zhongfan Chen, Kan Huang, Shi Gu, Nanyang Qian, Xiaoyuan Li, Youfeng Hong, Guojun Liu, Guoding Wan, Tingyong Shi, Zhiqian Dai, Jiazhi Zhu, Zhibai Gui and so on, who had taught here successively bringing the rich cultural heritage and tradition for the school. After the restoration of discipline construction in 1978, Zhusheng Xu, Zhiren Zou, Qi Huang, Guchao Shen and other successive leaders and deans, inherited the past and opened future, strengthened innovation step by step, highlighted our own characteristics, persevered in highlevel development. When coming into information era, we renamed our department as Information Management in 1992, upgraded into School of Information Management and joined the iSchools in 2011.In 2020, the school consists of more than 60 faculties and staffs, a number of leading scientists and more than 800 students. 3 Chang Jiang Scholars, 1 Academician of European Academy of Sciences and Arts, and 1 Senior Professor of Nanjing University formed the leaders team of our school, and followed by another 11 outstanding professors who are voted as chairman or vice-chairman in various national academy boards. Recent years, more and more young elites who got PhD degrees abroad are rushing into our school, injecting fresh but dynamic and international energies into our school.\n\nA saying says that a tree has to strike a firm root before it can flourish. A river has to have a fully dredged source before it can flow unceasingly far, which implicated the philosophy and pedagogy of our school. The spirit of information management science is multidiscipline and application science, thus it has to integrate and merge computer science, information science , social science, management science and even humanity science into new knowledge to create new values and collaborative innovations. We are frequently promoted by the significant advances in information technology and widespread application of new business, accordingly we have to incorporate our professional curriculum design so that the subject knowledge is synchronized with the development of innovative technologies; we are always concerned with organizational and social changes and have the ability to respond to the needs of national strategies, policies, governance and operation, to provide think-tank services for our country in the strategic analysis, public policy research, intelligence work, etc.\n\nWe are proud of the achievements we have made for the school, and are proud of the scholars who created history of the school in the past. We are grateful to the alumni and social colleagues who are always concerned about the development of our school. We also sincerely expect the young talents to come to apply a job and young students to come to study in our school and we will extend deepest welcome to you!",

            "iSchoolDescription": "The Department of Literature and Information was established in March 1964 as a library department with 20 admissions quota. After that, in 1971, a master's course in graduate school was newly established, and in March 1974, a doctoral course in this study was established for the first time in Korea. In March 1991, the department was renamed Literature Information Department in response to internal and external changes in the information society. As of 2014, the number of graduates has reached about 1,800 over the past 50 years. These alumni play a leading role in various fields such as Korean book relations, media and publishing, general companies, public institutions, and IT fields. The Department of Literature and Information aims to maintain social effectiveness by continuously operating subjects in the traditional subject areas of library and bibliography, while providing more professional undergraduate education in the field of information by reflecting the current trend of the \"digital era\" and \"big data era.\" As part of this, the Department of Literature and Information obtained membership for the first time in Korea as an international iSchool consortium with very difficult membership conditions such as education and research capabilities in February 2014. Above all, it is currently selecting a specialized project in the Seoul metropolitan area and is establishing a new data science curriculum that trains data scientists in the big data era, and is set to be officially launched in the first semester of 2015.\n\nThe research area of literature information technology is very wide ranging from information system and IT fields, information management and search, information classification and organization, and ancient literature management to information center management. The research field is largely divided into three areas: social science aspects related to overcoming information problems, humanities aspects for analyzing the organization, content, and types of information of knowledge, and engineering aspects of digital libraries and databases. Therefore, literature information can be said to be a science with convergence-complex characteristics between interdisciplinary systems. The educational goal of this course is to understand the general theories and methodologies of these various areas and to have basic qualities as information and data experts to respond to user needs and organizational and social information needs through the application of IT. Due to the nature of literature information, practical understanding of practice is required, and industry-academic cooperation classes are actively conducted as well as lectures by external experts at the master's and doctorate levels. In addition, foreign teachers are recruited in line with global issues, and as of 2014, the high level of international language (English) lectures is maintained at 44%.\n\nAfter graduating from the Department of Literature and Information, conditions for librarians such as the National Library of Korea, the National Assembly Library, the library of each company, and the school library are basically available, but the scope of entry is diverse.\n",

As in 1987, the School has two departments - the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n\nWith the formation of the School, a new four year honours degree, the Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, was offered. The School also offered the Bachelor of Science, a three year degree.\n\nIn 2002, the School started offering two additional degrees: the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours (BE(Hons)) and the Bachelor of Computer Graphic Design (BCGD). In the BE (Hons) degree, students can enrol in the Software Engineering programme. Other engineering programmes are offered by the School of Engineering. In 2018, the Bachelor of Design was introduced, replacing the BCGD. This degree has the four majors of Communication Design, Industrial Design, Interface Design and Media Design.\n\nIn 2014 we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the internet in New Zealand - an achievement made possible in 1989 with the help of the School.\n\nWe also launched New Zealand's first MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) in 2013 and have introduced the country's first Cyber Security Lab and Master of Cyber Security.  In 2016, the School was accepted as a member of iSchools, making it the first iSchool in New Zealand.",

SIM is committed to develop interdisciplinary talents and professional leaders in information management. As a key school supported by the National \"985 Project\" and \"211 Project\", SIM has been consistently ranked the first in the field.\n\nThe predecessor of SIM was the Books Division of Boone University at Wuchang, which was established in 1920 and became an independent specialty school, namely, the Boone Library School at Wuchang in 1929. In 1953, the school merged into Wuhan University and became the Department of Library Science of Wuhan University. In 1984, it was approved by the original Ministry of Education of China (MOE) to be renamed as the School of Library and Information Science of Wuhan University. In 2001, its name changed to the School of Information Management of Wuhan University.\n\nIn the development for more than 90 years, SIM believes that \"Pioneering Creation, Pragmatic Entrepreneurship, and Leading Innovation\" should be the notion for teaching.
